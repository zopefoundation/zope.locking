1.3 (unreleased)
----------------


------------------
1.2.2 (2011-01-31)
------------------

- Consolidate duplicate evolution code.

- Split generations config into its own zcml file.


------------------
1.2.1 (2010-01-20)
------------------

- Bug fix: the generation added in 1.2 did not properly clean up
  expired tokens, and could leave the token utility in an inconsistent
  state.


----------------
1.2 (2009-11-23)
----------------

- Bug fix: tokens were stored in a manner that prevented them from
  being cleaned up properly in the utility's _principal_ids mapping.
  Make zope.locking.tokens.Token orderable to fix this, as tokens
  are stored as keys in BTrees.

- Add a zope.app.generations Schema Manager to clean up any lingering
  tokens due to this bug.  Token utilities not accessible through the
  component registry can be cleaned up manually with
  zope.locking.generations.fix_token_utility.

- TokenUtility's register method will now add the token to the utility's
  database connection if the token provides IPersistent.

- Clean up the tests and docs and move some common code to testing.py.

- Fix some missing imports.
